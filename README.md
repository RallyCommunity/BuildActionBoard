Build Action Board
==================

## Overview

Provide at-a-glance status of all builds configured for teams.  
Latest status includes both the health and identification of 
the current build and last good build.  To better describe nature
of broken health, the number of failed builds since last good build is 
also shown.

This app also provides cross-panel communcation to [CI Build Report](https://github.com/RallyCommunity/build-dashboard)
and [Build Breakdown](https://github.com/EddieGotherman/BuildBreakdown) apps to provide immediate drilldown into
changeset and test case failures.
